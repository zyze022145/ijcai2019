We show some visualization results of DAM module in this folder:

1. As shown in 0.png-4.png, we show the direction activation（left） of different query images（right） in the DAM module. 
Different colors represent that different directions are activated. We can see that, in contrast to the query image, 
different texture regions in the image are activated, and the direction activation is inconsistent, and the same texture 
region exhibits overall consistency.

2. As shown in 5.png and 6.png,  regardless of how the affine transformation is performed on the same reference texture image,
its direction activation is almost unchanged.
